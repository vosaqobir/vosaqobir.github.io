From predictions involving a worldwide human revolution to the Antichrist ruling the world, it is no surprise that different ideas have been proposed regarding the end times and what will occur during them.\nWhile there are many different theories about the end days, perhaps one of the biggest questions we could ask is: How does the Bible tell us God’s end-times plan will play out for His creation? Rather than speculate over what might occur, we should seek to know what He has already revealed to us through Scripture concerning the subject. As a result, this article will attempt to answer this question.\nLooking at Jesus' Answers Jesus was a man who uniquely knew and understood how things would unfold in the near future. For instance, Mark 13 records Jesus’ detailed description about the end times and how they would happen. While the exact description, timing, sequence, and order of everything has not yet taken place; it is clear from his words that Jesus understands these final events more than anyone else alive today. This is proven by His teaching and use of the phrase “let us not be alarmed” (Mark 13:7), which reveals Jesus’ true nature as the prince of peace and His true intent with humanity.\nThe first thing Jesus did was to answer the disciples when they asked Him about the fig tree (i.e. the nation of Israel) and when it would be restored. His response was not to give a direct timeline but to tell His disciples “things which must take place after this” (Mark 13:4). In this passage, Jesus’ meaning of \"this\" had to do with the many physical signs occurring around the disciples as well as the tumultuous nature of their own lives as they lived under oppression from Rome. Ultimately, Jesus wanted His disciples to understand that the tribulation would begin with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem which would lead to Him being killed in its ruins, thereby showing them that Jesus is the way to salvation. Moreover, the appearance of false prophets and the growth of godlessness in the earth would also transpire before the final culmination took place.\nJesus’ warning about the death of the temple in Jerusalem may sound like an odd one, since it occurred almost two thousand years ago. However, when Jesus foretold these events, He was considering the spiritual disposition of each individual by asking them if they were willing to abandon their own personal ego and put their faith in Christ instead. When Jesus talks to us about the destruction of Jerusalem, He shows us how our confidence in Him will either remain or leave. Whereas, those who let fear reign in their hearts—and selfishly focus only on themselves instead of Christ—will experience the end of Jerusalem and ultimately end up desiring the Antichrist’s rule upon the earth.\nThirdly, we need to understand the context in which Jesus makes such a statement, which involves the period just before His return. During this time period, humanity will find itself faced with a series of wars, dangers, and suffering to the extent that it will yearn for an even worse situation to come. In Mark 13:20, Jesus tells us that it will be so bad that it will be easier to endure the wrath of God than the wrath of humans. And while some might think that this threatens to prove true due to the horrific conditions of the current world, people will face much greater sufferings in the future (Rev. 6:4-8).\nFor example, consider the Great Tribulation that will occur as a sign of the second coming (Matt. 24:29-31); when Jesus speaks of a storm of suffering like humanity has never seen (Luke 21:25-26), and in the words of Jesus (John 14:6), “he who endures to the end of the age.” These things will all take place according to Jesus’ promise.\nIn conclusion, we should recognize that Jesus has a different perspective on life than anyone else alive today because He sees more about your future than you ever could and because He knows better than anyone else what He can do to help you be saved from it. So, regardless of what happens in the days ahead—when there seems to be no end in sight—we should trust Jesus because He knows best how these events will play out and what God’s plan is for us all.\n","wordCount":"753","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-12T15:08:53Z","dateModified":"2024-03-12T15:08:53Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vosaqobir.github.io/posts/40048205-what-does-jesus-teach-us-about-god-s-end-times-plan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vosa Qobir","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vosaqobir.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vosaqobir.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vosa Qobir (Alt + H)">Vosa Qobir</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What Does Jesus Teach Us about God's End-Times Plan?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-12 15:08:53 +0000 UTC'>March 12, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Looking at Jesus' Answers">Looking at Jesus' Answers</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Ask any human on Earth how he or she thinks the future will pan out, and you will get different answers.
