These beliefs were called the 5 fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith:\nThe inerrancy of Scripture; the virgin birth of Jesus Christ; the substitutionary atonement; the bodily resurrection of Jesus; the second coming of Jesus. Christian Fundamentalists are not simply committed to these doctrines, but they seek to defend them against criticism. Over time the term ‘fundamentalism’ has been applied to other religions, though the term is more commonly used to describe conservative Protestantism or sometimes Pentecostalism. In this article I will be focusing on Christian Fundamentalism in general and what it means to be a Fundamentalist today.\nThe Good There is good in any group who stand for the truth. Fundamentalists seek to preserve doctrine, morality, and virtues that society is rejecting. They are correct when they say that we are moving towards a post-Christian society. Christianity is becoming less relevant and is increasingly seen as a fringe belief system. We must rise up as Christians and be bold in our witness, which is why many Fundamentalists think we should argue for Christianity rather than just assuming it's true.\nLikewise, we have a duty to challenge a secular worldview that isn't working for us. How many times do you hear about suicide? Or depression? Or drug or alcohol abuse? Or violence? It's terrible. And Christianity gives us hope where there is no hope! We don't want to be like the world that is spiritually dead. Our identity is in Christ alone, and He is enough.\nThe movement has brought new thinking into the church. Fundamentalism has challenged some churches to revise their fundamental understanding of the Bible, such as their view of inerrancy and their views on issues like evolution and gender roles (to varying degrees). Yes, I do believe that evolution is a scientific fact, and that creationism is a theory. And yes, I do believe that women can have a role in ministry, and that the definition of gender roles hasn't changed with the culture. However, the theological fallout from Fundamentalism has given us a more open mindset about what we can do for the Kingdom of God. That is worth its weight in gold, because if it wasn't for Fundamentalists, perhaps Evangelicals would still be where they started—in the Middle Ages!\nThey give us a glimpse at how much work needs to be done. Sadly, Fundamentalism has often veered off course by putting too much emphasis on secondary issues; thus they become legalistic Christians. They also became obsessed with finding solutions without realizing that sin cannot be solved by human effort alone. Yes, we need to fight for the truth because our faith is worth defending. But the battle is not ours, it is the Lord's battle. We are here to fight our own flesh and the devil, rather than society.\nThe Bad Some people treat Fundamentalism as gospel rather than theology. By being extremely dogmatic with their views, they make Christianity less attractive. You're supposed to be \"tolerant\" as a Christian, but in reality, intolerance runs strong in many churches nowadays. Yes, this blog is more Calvinist-leaning, but my stance is clearly not Calvinist. This is because I know that we can't define doctrine, and those who try are committing heresy (by adding to Scripture). For example, let's say you aren't sure if someone is truly saved, and you call them on it. But instead of welcoming you with love, they accuse you of being \"rude\" or \"disruptive.\" If they're real Christians, they shouldn't feel threatened by your concern. After all, it's only trying to point out someone who isn't living up to biblical standards. They should rejoice in the thought that they might finally be living righteously before God again, and thank you for caring so much about them. But that isn't how it usually goes down.\nAnother example is when someone disagrees with a church's position on homosexuality, and refuses to go back. But again, what does this prove about the church's teachings? Wouldn't they be more likely to find an alternative form of ministry if they had a better understanding of their sexuality? What does this tell us about churches who refuse to even discuss the topic? They obviously want nothing to do with something they may disagree with, and no one should force anyone into anything just because they disagree with it. That's why God gives people free will.\nFundamentalism has created the impression that Christianity is regressive. The old testament mentality still exists in churches today, which discourages people from wanting to join such places. They see the negative stereotype of Christianity everywhere around them, so it comes as no surprise that many churchgoers live in fear, thinking that they will not be welcomed for their views and actions. Why isn't there more balance? Why is there so much hatred against homosexuals, for example, when Jesus never said a single word about homosexuality? Why does everyone think Christians hate people so much, when that is completely false? Why do Fundamentalists keep acting so legalistic and dogmatic, when they are actually hurting themselves and others? The reason for all these questions lies within the doctrines, which are misinterpreted to encourage people away from the Truth, the Gospel, and the salvation Jesus offers us. If you look at the culture, Fundamentalism has become an anathema (just look at the media!), and yet they keep acting like it's no big deal.\nFundamentalism puts a lot of pressure on people. By demanding strict adherence to the Scriptures, they are making it harder for new Christians to join their ranks. I know some people who do not agree with particular theological beliefs, but they chose to stick with such churches because of the people involved or the amount of work they put into building relationships. Others just want someone to talk to, not necessarily a pastor or priest, but someone who understands their struggles. What about other beliefs? What about opinions, worldviews, or lifestyles that people are questioning about? Are Fundamentalists willing to challenge someone who doesn't agree with them? The answer is almost always no, sadly. They are stuck on what they believe and don't want anyone else telling them differently, hence they continue their divisive ways. As a result, many people leave the faith altogether after having suffered under Fundamentalism for decades.\nFundamentalism often presents as the only way to experience Christianity. Because most churchgoers feel there is only one way to be right with God, they start avoiding personal connections by pushing other people away. They build up walls between themselves and others, and expect everyone to either get on board or face rejection. Why should that be the case? Why do we have to push people away for no apparent reason, if they're happy with being single, or struggle with drugs/alcohol/sex etc.? Conclusion In my opinion, there is a middle ground to be found in the middle of the two extremes - and it's worth searching for. The Bible teaches balance and wisdom, so why not take those lessons to heart as well? Whether it is Fundamentalism or theological liberalism, both are dangerous ideologies that have hurt countless people. Who wants to be associated with such ideas, especially when they aren't even theologically sound? The Bible tells us to do the exact opposite, and we should listen.\nBaptism Baptism is an essential part of Christianity, and all Christians are commanded to go into the world and be baptized. Unfortunately, many of us are… - #### Muslim Conversion\nThe most important thing in this world is to know Jesus Christ as your personal savior.
