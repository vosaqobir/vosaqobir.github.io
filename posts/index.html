Technology-driven progress is often considered to be the greatest determinant of many of the challenges our world faces today. In this article, we examine the biblical perspective of technology as it relates to our views on progress. We consider a broad definition of progress before going on to focus more specifically on technological innovation. By drawing upon several biblical principles and patterns of thought from scripture, we explore the ways in which both the Giver and the Creator of everything we have can help us navigate what will otherwise remain as a challenging journey for as long as time itself lasts....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-08 15:41:25 +0000 UTC'>March 8, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to How Should Christians Approach Progress in Technology?" href=https://vosaqobir.github.io/posts/50211668-how-should-christians-approach-progress-in-technology/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Self-Care: Selfish Habit or Holy Endeavor?</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>The concept of "self" has been investigated and debated since its conception.
